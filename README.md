## 🌱 About the Project

**BreatheWell** is my final-year dissertation project focused on reducing isolation and loneliness among COPD patients. It combines accessible design, emotional support, and community-driven features to create a safe and inclusive space.

This project is inspired by my late **Nan** and **Uncle**, whose experiences with COPD shaped my belief in compassionate, inclusive technology. BreatheWell is built to honour their memory - and to help others in a similar position feel less alone.
